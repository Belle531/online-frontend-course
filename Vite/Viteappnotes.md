# Here’s a summary of what we’ve done so far on your React “About Me” project:

## Project Setup & Structure

You started a React project using Vite (a modern, fast alternative to Create React App).
Your project folder structure includes:
src/components/AboutMe.jsx (your main component)
src/App.jsx and src/main.jsx
An images or assets folder for your profile picture

## Component Creation

You built an AboutMe.jsx component with:
Your name
A profile picture (we’ve debugged this, but it’s still pending a fix)
A short bio
Styling
Used Bootstrap-style classes (container, mt-5, etc.) for layout and appearance.

### Image Troubleshooting

Tried several times to display your local profile image in the component.
Discussed:
Using the correct import path and file naming conventions (no spaces, use import ... from ...).
Storing images in src/assets/ or src/images/ and referencing them correctly in React/Vite.
This issue is still unresolved, but you decided to pause and move on for now.

### Project Environment

Clarified that your project uses Vite (with npm run dev to start), not Create React App.
Explained the differences between Vite and CRA, and that your React code remains the same in both.
What’s Next?
You can continue building out your About Me page (adding sections, improving content).
When ready, you can return to troubleshooting the image issue.
