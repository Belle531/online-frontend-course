# What is Vite and How is It Different from Create React App (CRA)?

1. Vite vs. Create React App
Create React App (CRA) was the standard tool to bootstrap React projects for years.
Vite is a newer, faster build tool that works with React, Vue, and more. It’s become very popular because it’s much faster than CRA, especially for development.
2. How do you know you’re using Vite?
If you ran npm create vite@latest or see a file called vite.config.js or vite.config.ts in your project, you’re using Vite.
The dev server command is usually npm run dev (Vite), instead of npm start (CRA).
The output you showed earlier (VITE v7.0.6 ready in ...) confirms you’re using Vite.
3. What’s the difference in project structure or workflow?
Most of the React code (components, JSX, etc.) is the same!
The only differences are in how the project is started, built, and configured.
Instead of a public folder for static assets, Vite prefers you keep images and files in src/assets/ or similar and import them.
4. Scripts in package.json
Your package.json probably has something like:

JSON
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
Instead of:

JSON
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
###  What Should You Do?

You can keep building your React app as normal!
The main difference is you run npm run dev to start your local server.
When you want to use an image, import it (as we’ve discussed).
For production, you’d use npm run build.
Why did we end up with Vite instead of CRA?
Vite is now recommended by the React docs and community, and many tutorials use it.
If your instructor wanted CRA, but you have Vite, just let them know! (But Vite is actually better and newer.)


 Summary Table look at image
Feature	Create React App (CRA)	Vite
Init command	npx create-react-app	npm create vite@latest
Start dev server	npm start	npm run dev
Build for prod	npm run build	npm run build
Static assets	public/	src/assets/ (import them)
Config file	None by default	vite.config.js/ts
If you want to switch to CRA, I can help you do that.
But you can finish your assignment with Vite—they both work for React!

Would you like to continue with Vite, or do you want to switch to Create React App?
